                <p>Howdy! My name is Carlos Carrillo! Thanks for checking out my site. I am a filmmaker and photographer
                    who has a passion for technology and coding. I’m from <strong>Houston, TX</strong> but love to
                    travel and consider my
                    home the world. My passion for film, photography, and technology started years ago when I was a kid.
                    As a kid I would mess around with the tech at the house to see how it was all put together and how
                    it worked. Once I was in middle and high school, I joined the robotics team where we competed in FRC
                    and FTC. As for film and photography my dad and I would always watch movies together and I
                    absolutely loved that, but as I got older that love turned into a curiosity of how they were made so
                    I started teaching myself filmmaking in 8th grade. This led me to studying computer science and art
                    once I made it to college.</p>

                <p>I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a> in December 2019 with a
                    degree in University Studies –
                    Architecture with minors in computer science and art. I am currently back at A&M completing my
                    computer science bachelor’s and hope to start my master’s in Visualization soon after. While at A&M
                    I have been a part of the Aggie Magic Circle where I learned to become a magician. You may be
                    asking, “what does this have to do with film, photography, or development?” and the answer is quite
                    a lot. The actual magic part is probably irrelevant most of the time, but the psychology that we had
                    to understand and apply effectively to create good magic shows is very relevant. Knowing how the
                    audience’s attention works allows me to use that information to guide the audience’s focus to where
                    I need in my filmmaking, photography, and design of any software/website I may create.</p>

                <p>As for my interests in accessibility, I have an interest addressing issues related to <strong>color
                        blindness, ADHD, contrast needs, & dyslexia.</strong> Essentially, addressing needs through
                    proper HTML tagging & CSS designs. If you're interested in connecting fill out your name and a bit
                    about you below.</p>
